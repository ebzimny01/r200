# Generator Monitoring Application using a Raspberry Pi and WiFi

THIS IS A TEST UPDATE NUMBER 2()()()!!!!!! This project will monitor a backup generator that utilizes the Generac Evolution or Nexus Controllers over a WiFi or wired connection. Generac, Eaton, Honeywell and Siemens Home Backup Generators use these Generac controllers. Honeywell and Eaton call the controllers Sync 1.0 (Nexus) and Sync 2.0 (Evolution) in their documentation however all of these companies sell generators that use the controllers supported by this project. The project is written mostly in python and has been tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 (Pi Zero and Pi 2 has also been validated). Ideally you would need to create a physical enclosure for your raspberry pi and possibly [make a cable](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/wiki/Making-a-Cable) to connect the raspberry pi to the Evolution or Nexus controller. If you are comfortable doing these things and you have a backup generator that has an Generac Evolution or Nexus controller then this project may be of interest to you.
 
## Functionality

## Support
This project is free to use under the posted license agreement. It was written and is supported by one person with testing and some documentation supported by users of the software. I originally created this project for my personal use however I decided to make the project available to anyone interested, however I do accept tips via paypal:

[![paypal](https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_US/i/btn/btn_donateCC_LG.gif)](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=8Z4TSR22RLMWQ&lc=US&item_name=jgyates&item_number=jgyates&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_LG%2egif%3aNonHosted)


## Testing
This software was written by one person with full time access to one generator. The primary model used for testing and development is a liquid cooled model with an evolution controller. The software was written with every intention of working on liquid and air-cooled models with the Evolution or Nexus controller however the author has not tested all scenarios. Some testing has been done with an air cooled Nexus controller, however not all firmware versions and models have been tested.

In an effort to expand compatibility and functionality, from time to time I may use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/issues) of this project to request input from people using the software. This input will will allow greater compatibility and new features to be added.

## Known Issues:
The Evolution Controller contains a register that should hold details about the model of the generator. I believe I have decoded this register however I need additional data points to fully validate. My controller was replaced and as a result, the register on my system has not been properly initialized. Please see the project issue tracker issue on [this topic](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/issues/10).

Nexus Controllers are currently supported however the functionality is reduced due to the Nexus Controller supporting fewer features. On Nexus Controllers the ability to detect battery charging, transfer switch relay state and set the quiet mode is not functional. All other functionality support by the genmon.py and the Nexus controller should work as expected.

If the legacy method of setting the exercise time is used (it is used on all Nexus controllers) then you can only set a future time on the current day of the week. You can set the exercise time to any day and time, except earlier in the day on the current day of the week.

While a large amount of functionality is included in this software, some items may be missing. For example, the Evolution Controller has the concept of alarm log entries and alarm codes. Alarm log entries are the collection of the time, date and a description of a give alarm along with an alarm code. Alarm codes are a 4 digit number that corresponds to a specific alarm condition. The alarm codes and the alarm log may not display every alarm log entry properly in the user interface. I have attempted to decode these values and according to the documentation I have decoded many, if not most, of them. If you run into a situation where the one of the logs entries or values returned reports and unknown value feel free to let me know (via opening a project issue). Generally this can be easily resolved by sending the decoded log values supplied in the email or web interface and a picture of the corresponding log entry (match the time and date and alarm code) from the Controller display. This really comes down to a list of numbers that correspond to displayed strings in the Evolution Controller firmware. My generator only has a finite set of alarm log entries so not every string displayed may be decoded my genmon.py. The alarm conditions and alarm codes are in the file ALARMS.txt. The list of alarm codes was taken from the Generac documentation so this list is likely close to complete however the short description of the alarm contained in the alarm log may need input from others to complete. Input from others on unknown logs and alarms can be submitted [here](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/issues/12) and [here](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/issues/13)

For Evolution Controllers, the software will show the state the some active relays (Starter, Fuel Relay etc). These relays differ slightly from air cooled to liquid cooled models. The software shows the state of the relay in the controller, not the actual state of what the relay is driving. For example, if the active relay states that the Transfer Switch (Evo Liquid Cooled  models) is active, this means that the controller is attempting to activate the transfer switch. If something is wrong with your switch or the connection is bad between the relay and the switch, your transfer switch may not truly be activated (i.e. there is no feedback mechanism back to the controller). If you generator is working properly then you can expect the relays to match what they are driving.

To summarize, if you see any unknown or things are not working as expected, please open an issue on the project.

## Placement of your Raspberry Pi
If you have a large generator, the placement of your Raspberry Pi could be important due to [EMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference). Larger generators will produce more EMI when starting. For example a 48kw diesel generator will generate enough EMI to cause CRC errors when the generator starts if the Raspberry Pi enclosure is mounted in the generator enclosure with the engine. If the Raspberry Pi enclosure is moved to the generator enclosure compartment with the controller, no CRC errors are seen. EMI may not be an issue with smaller liquid cooled generators. There are several ways to resolve EMI issues however the best solution is dependant on your particular site needs (generator, how much space you need for your Pi, how much space you have available, etc). The project [wiki](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/wiki/Hardware) has information regarding a typical enclosure for the Raspberry Pi, however the example enclosure is not RF shielded. A shielded enclosure would be another way to solve this issue. 

## Connectivity
This application was written to be agnostic of the underlying network media (i.e. WiFi, Ethernet, etc). Testing and development was performed with WiFi. WiFi access points were connected to an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) so connectivity is not lost power is transferred from the utility to the generator.

## Setting Up Your Raspberry Pi (Serial Port)
Since there are several version of the raspberry Pi out and also several options regarding the operating system, I will leave this section somewhat minimal. I used a Raspberry Pi 3 with Raspbian Jessie Lite. There are many resources on the web for setting up a Raspberry Pi so I will only include links for setting up the serial port. The Linux device name of the serial port changed or at least the symbolic link changed starting with the Raspberry Pi 3 from /dev/ttyAMA0 to /dev/serial0 so if you are using the on board serial port you will want to validate the device name and make sure genmon.conf reflects the serial device name of your Raspberry Pi and Linux distribution. The following two links are helpful in setting up the serial port on the Raspberry Pi:

[General Setup of the serial port for a Raspberry Pi](http://elinux.org/RPi_Serial_Connection)

[An updated serial port setup instructions based on the Raspberry Pi 3](http://spellfoundry.com/2016/05/29/configuring-gpio-serial-port-raspbian-jessie-including-pi-3/) 

One important step is to validate your serial port is working properly. You can validate the serial port is working properly by using the program serialtest.py in this repository. To validate your serial port connect the RS-232 transmit to RS-232 receive and follow the instructions in the software section on serialtest.py. Also, you can validate your cable by connecting your cable to your serial port and connecting transmit to receive at the far end of the cable so you will be looping back through your cable, then repeat the serialtest.py test.

The project [wiki](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/wiki/Setting-up-your-Pi-and-genmon) also has a description of setting up the Pi with genmon.py.

# Software

## genmon.py (required)

genmon.py is a python program to communicate with the Generac Evolution or Nexus Controller used in some liquid and air cooled standby generators. The program is written using python 2.7, earlier versions have not been tested. Python 3.x has been minimally tested (v3.4). This program will communicate with the Evolution or Nexus Controller over the serial port using the MODBUS protocol. The application will allow the display and monitoring of the generator much like the Generac Mobile Link product.

Once setup the genmon.py program will send an email when your generator does interesting things (power goes out, alarm on the generator, weekly exercise, etc). The program will also allow emails to be sent to an IMAP email folder. The program monitors the IMAP folder and takes commands from the email subject. The format of the subject of the email should have "generator:"  followed by one or more of the following commands:

        Commands:
          status      - display engine and line information
          maint       - display maintenance and service information
          outage      - display current and last outage (since program launched)
                       info, also shows utility min and max values
          monitor     - display communication statistics and monitor health
          logs        - display all alarm, on/off, and maintenance logs
          registers   - display contents of registers being monitored
          settime     - set generator time to system time
          setexercise - set the exercise time of the generator. 
                          i.e. setexercise=Monday,13:30
          setquiet    - enable or disable exercise quiet mode, 
                          i.e.  setquiet=on or setquiet=off
          setremote   - issue remote command. format is setremote=command, 
                         where command is start, stop, starttransfer,
                         startexercise. i.e. setremote=start
          help        - Display help on commands

         Example subject:
            generator: status maint

            generator: setexercise=Tuesday,23:45 setquiet=on

A few notes about commands: 

The setremote command issues commands directly to the controller. Start and stop commands should be back to back, i.e. is is not recommended to issue start followed by starttransfer, you should have a stop after each start command. Also, when the starttransfer command is used, once a stop command is issued the controller will set the transfer switch back to "utility" but the generator will continue to run in "cool down" mode for few minutes. This is normal and the behavior is controlled by the controller.

The setexercise command can not set an exercise time that is within a few minutes of the current generator time. This is a limitation of the controller.

The settime command will set the generator time to the time of the Raspberry Pi. If you Raspberry Pi is setup to your correct time zone and your Linux distribution (e.i. Raspbian ) uses network time protocol (NTP) then this will set your generator time to the accurate time. Since the register interface to the generator controller does not expose seconds, genmon.py will wait until the Raspberry Pi time seconds are zero before setting the command. This allow the time to be accurate within a minute and the seconds that are off from the exact time are consistent. For this reason the time may not be update for one minute when this command is used.

The program uses the file genmon.conf to for configuration data. Edit this file place it in the /etc directory before running the program. genmon.py uses the following modules so they are external dependencies of the program and they will need to be installed before running the program:

* [crcmod](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/crcmod) - used for MODBUS CRC calculation. 

Install via the following command: 

    sudo pip install crcmod


* [pyserial](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial/2.7) - used for serial communication. 

This can be installed via the following command:

     sudo apt-get install python-serial

* [configparser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html) - used for parsing configuration file

This can be installed via the following command: 

     sudo pip install configparser

Note: Python 2.7 includes the ConfigParser (mixed case) library, however for better python 3.x compatibility this project uses the configparser (lower case) library.

In addition the the external dependencies there are additional python modules included in this project that are used:

* mymail.py - This module provides support for sending email and monitoring an IMAP email folder for incoming mail. The mail module can be configured by modifying the mymail.conf file and placing it in the /etc directory.
* mylog.py - This modules provides logging support to the other modules.        
* ALARMS.txt - This text file contains generator error codes with descriptions and potential solutions. It is used by the program to supply additional details when error conditions are detected by the generator monitor.

Log files for errors are generated by genmon.py, mymail.py and for serial communications. These files are written to /var/log and named genmon.log, mymail.log and myserial.log.

A note about email and security: The genmon.py app monitors folder on an IMAP email account for emails with a subject containing "generator:". If this is found, the remaining characters of the subject filed are parsed for commands for the monitor program. Since commands are sent to genmon.py via the subject  line of an email, is is suggested that some level of email filtering occur on the receiving email account. For example, gmail supports email filters that if emails arrive from specific people with specific words in the subject, move them to specific folders. You could then have genmon.py monitor the specific folder used in your filter to only allow specific emails to send commands to genmon.py. If this approach is used then genmon.py can be configured (via mymail.com) to monitor a specific IMAP folder.

Gmail IMAP has been tested with this application. It should be easy to test this other email providers. All mail processing is contained in mymail.py and mymail.conf.

Due to the location of log files and conf files, root privileges are needed to execute the program. Other than these files, there are no requirements of root privileges.

Installation of genmon.py is simple. All python source files (*.py) can be put in a single directory, all config files (*.conf) go in /etc. Edit the *.conf files so they are specific to your installation (email user name and password, etc). You can launch the program as a background application if needed, i.e. "python genmon.py &". Also I use crontab to load the application as a background process on boot by launching a bash script via crontab. The script loads the app via the "python genmon.py &" command.

To run genmon.py as a foreground application:
   
    sudo python genmon.py
   
To run as a background app:

    sudo python genmon.py &
   
To stop genmon.py as a foreground application type Ctrl+C. The following command will stop the running instance of genmon.py:

    sudo pkill -f genmon.py

## Configuring genmon.py
The configuration file genmon.conf is used to set options for the genmon.py program. If you do not know what type of controller you have on your generator there are pictures in Diagrams folder in this repository of both Evolution and Nexus controller front panels. The genmon.py will auto-detect your controller type but you can override that in genmon.conf.

[Evolution Controller Front Panel](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/blob/master/Diagrams/Evolution_Controller.jpg)

[Nexus Controller Front Panel](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/blob/master/Diagrams/Nexus_Controller.jpg)

Also, if you generator has as radiator then it is liquid cooled, otherwise it is air cooled. These options are used for configuration and enabling debugging. genmon.conf has the following options:

    [GenMon]
    # name of the site, used in the web interface and email output (required)
    sitename = SiteName

    # the serial device name of your serial port. Normally  /dev/serial0 or
    # /dev/ttyAMA0 for onboard Raspberry Pi Serial ports (required)
    port = /dev/serial0

    # the name of the folder in the mailbox for searching for incoming email
    # commands (required)
    incoming_mail_folder = Generator

    # once an email command has been processed by genmon.py the email is moved to
    # this mailbox folder (required)
    processed_mail_folder = Generator/Processed

    # The TCP port used for communicating with the other apps like ClientInterface.py
    # and the web interface (required)
    server_port = 9082

    # the Modbus slave address. This *should* not need to be changed from 9d (required)
    address = 9d

    # location of log files (required)
    loglocation = /var/log/

    # location of the text file containing descriptions of alarm codes (required)
    alarmfile = /home/pi/genmon/ALARMS.txt
    
    # enable genmon.py to output to the console if True. If this is false the other
    # display* commands below are ignored (optional, default False)
    displayoutput = False

    # display information about genmon.py to the console (optional, default False)
    displaymonitor = False

    # display controller register contents to the console (optional, default False)
    displayregisters = False

    # display generator status to the console (optional, default False)
    displaystatus = False

    # display maintenance information to the console (optional, default False)
    displaymaintenance = False

    # enable enable code to support reverse engineering of registers. This option,
    # when True creates a thread that will monitor registers in the controller and
    # send notifications of changed registers. Not used in normal operation (optional,
    # default False)
    enabledebug = False

    # This option will display the contents of additional registers that appear to be
    # associated with sensors of some type, for example one register outputs almost
    # half of the frequency. I assume this is used internally by the controller.
    # (optional, default False)
    displayunknown = False

    # (optional) This option enables (when True) using and alternate method for writing
    # the exercise time. Some version of the Evolution firmware only support the legacy
    # method of writing the exercise time. The legacy method is a bit more convoluted
    # and the current implementation may result in the exercise time being off by one
    # or two minutes from the request set value. (optional, default False).  Note
    # this option is forced True if a Nexus controller is detected or selected.
    # (e.g. use legacy exercise write if using a Nexus controller). When using this
    # method the exercise time must be at least three minutes or more from the current
    # generator time.
    #uselegacysetexercise = False
    
    # (optional) Disable the monitoring of the utility line voltage for detecting 
    # power outages. This will disable the sending of emails when a power outage is 
    # detected. If you have a Transfer Switch that monitors the utility line and starts 
    # your generator you may need to set this to true. Most transfer switches requires 
    # the generator controller to monitor the utility line voltage and notify the switch
    # to activate so in most cases this will not be needed. If you software is reading 
    # zero volts for the utility voltage and you are getting false emails regarding an
    # outage then enable this setting.
    #disableoutagecheck = False

    # (optional) True if monitoring a liquid cooled generator, False if air cooled. 
    # This option is for monitoring active relays in the controller, which are different 
    # for liquid vs air cooled generators. The software will auto-detect the type of 
    # generator cooling
    #liquidcooled = True
    
    # (optional). The software will auto-detect the controller type. The auto-detect
    # can be overridden with this setting. True for Evolution controller, False for
    # Nexus Controller.
    #evolutioncontroller = True
    
    # (optional) default True. This parameter is only valid for liquid cooled
    # Evolution generators, ignored for others. True if your generator uses diesel
    # or gasoline, false if you use  propane or natural gas. This value is used
    # to change how some register values are interpreted and displayed based on
    # the fuel type
    #petroleumfuel = True

    # (optional). This parameter will specify the full path of a file that will log
    # power outages. An outage is defined by the utility voltage dropping below the
    # generator's programmed threshold voltage. Typically the generator has a hold
    # off period (usually around 5 seconds) before the generator starts. If utility
    # power is rises above the threshold voltage before the hold off timer has
    # expired the generator will  not start, but the outage will still be logged.
    # If this parameter is not enabled (i.e. commented out) then the outage logging
    # will not function. To reset the outage log manually delete this file.
    # (e.g. "sudo rm /home/pi/genmon/outage.txt" )
    outagelog = /home/pi/genmon/outage.txt


## Configuring mymail.py

The following is a description of the options contained in mymail.conf, which is used to configure the mail support in mymail.py.

    [MyMail]
    email_pw = password
      # The password for the email account used for sending and receiving email

    email_account = myaccunt@gmail.com
      # the email account email address (sender email address)

    email_recipient = recipient@gmail.com
      # address that email are sent to. Multiple addresses are separated by commas

    smtp_server = smtp.gmail.com
      # the SMTP mail server used for sending email, leave empty to disable 
      # SMTP, i.e. "smtp_server ="
      
    imap_server = imap.gmail.com
      # the IMAP server address used for receiving email, leave empty to disable 
      # IMAP, i.e. "imap_server ="
      
    smtp_port = 587
      # the SMTP port used on the SMTP server for sending email
     
    #disableemail = false
      # optionally disable email use by the program. set to true to disable email 

      
## ClientInterface.py

The program ClientInterface.py is a test application for communicating with genmon.py via sockets. The ClientInterface.py program uses the supplied python module mylog.py and myclient.py so this the three files (mylog.py, myclient.py and ClientInterface.py must be in the same  directory of you are opting to usie ClientInterface.py). The ClientInterface.py app takes one command line argument, the IP address of the computer running genmon.py (the default is localhost). To issues commands to an instance genmon.py on a system at IP address of 192.168.11.100 you would do the following:

            python ClientInterface.py 192.168.11.100

Once the app is executed you should be faced with a prompt ">". From this prompt you can send commands to genmon.py. Commands are prefaced with "generator:". For example to issue the command "status" you would enter the "generator: status" at the ">" prompt when running ClientInterface.py. The commands accepted are listed in the genmon.py section and they match the email based commands.

ClientInterface.py logs errors to client.log in the current directory.

## gengpio.py (optional)

The program gengpio.py is a console python application that will communicate with genmon.py and set or reset GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.The application requires the supplied python module mylog.py and myclient.py so these files will need to be in the same directory as gengpio.py. The program takes one command line argument of the IP address of the system that genmon.py is running (localhost is default). 

* Generator READY GPIO 23 (pin 16)
* Generator ALARM GPIO 24 (pin 18)
* Generator SERVICE DUE GPIO 25 (pin 22)
* Generator EXERCISING GPIO 8 (pin 24)
* Generator RUNNING GPIO 7 (pin 26) (Running in Manual or Auto)
* Generator OFF GPIO 9 (pin 21)   (Off with Switch Off or Manual) 

The following GPIO will be activated on Evolution Controllers:

* Overspeed/Underspeed (alarms 1200-1206, 1600-1603) GPIO 5 (pin 29)
* Low Oil (alarm 1300) GPIO 6 (pin 31)
* High Temp (alarm 1400) GPIO 13 (pin 33
* RPM Sensor (alarm 1500-1521) GPIO 19 (pin 35)
* Overvoltage/Undervoltage (alarm 1800-1803, 1900-1906) GPIO 26 (pin 37)
* Overcrank (alarm 1100-1101) GPIO 21 (pin 40)
* Overload (alarm 2100-2103) GPIO 20 (pin 38)
* Governor (alarm 2500-2502) GPIO 16 (pin 36)
* Warning (alarm 0000, Evolution Air Cooled Only) GPIO 12 (pin 32)
 
 All outputs are high when active.
 
[Example of LED circuit connected to Raspberry Pi GPIO](http://raspi.tv/2013/rpi-gpio-basics-4-setting-up-rpi-gpio-numbering-systems-and-inputs). To execute gengpio.py type:

     python gengpio.py <IP Address of your Pi running genmon.py or omit for localhost>

## gengpioin.py (optional)

The program gengpioin.py is a console python application that will communicate with genmon.py and issue remote commands based on Raspberry Pi GPIO input pin. The application requires the supplied python module mylog.py and myclient.py so these files will need to be in the same directory as gengpio.py. The program takes one command line argument of the IP address of the system that genmon.py is running (localhost is default). The program uses the internal pull up resistors in the Broadcom chipset on the Raspberry Pi. The program also uses the python module RPI.GPIO which comes already installed on most raspberry Pi distributions. 

* If GPIO 17 (header pin 11) makes a high to low transition, the remote stop command is issued
* If GPIO 27 (header pin 13) makes a high to low transition, the remote start command is issued
* If GPIO 22 (header pin 15) makes a high to low transition, the remote start/transfer command is issued

To execute gengpioin.py type:

    python gengpioin.py <IP Address of your Pi running genmon.py or omit for localhost>

[Example GPIO input circuit](http://elinux.org/RPi_GPIO_Interface_Circuits). Note: external pull up resistor is not needed as it is handled by the chipset.

## genlog.py (optional)

This program will log the state of the generator (RUNNING, EXERCISE,READY, ALARM, SERVICE) along with a date/time to a comma delimited text file (.csv). This file can be opened by Excel. The date/time entry can be formated to an Excel date/time data type. This will allow an analysis to be performed on your generator usage. The program has the following command line syntax:

     python genlog.py -a <IP Address or localhost> -f <outputfile>

Example:

     python genlog.py -a 192.168.1.50 -f logfile.csv

This program requires myclient.py and mylog.py. This program can be executed remotely (not on the Raspberry Pi) if the IP address of the Raspberry Pi is provided on the command line. If this program is executed as at boot from a crontab job you musty specify the full path of the output file (i.e. /home/pi/out.csv. If you execute this program locally you can use a relative path (i.e. ./out.csv).

## /OtherApps/check_monitor_system.py (optional)

In addition the the above mentioned ClientInterface.py application, genmon.py supports communicating via the socket interface so the application and generator can be monitored by network monitoring tools like Nagios. The program check_monitor_system.py can be used with as a Nagios Plugin to monitor genmon.py. See https://www.nagios.org/ for Nagios details. check_monitor_system.py is the name of the supplied nagios plug-in.
    
 ## genserv.py (optional)
genserv.py is a python application that uses the Flask library/framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/). This approach allows a quick and simple python socket interface to be translated to a javascript based web interface. The genserv.py app, when executed, will serve up a simple web page that will display the status of the generator. Both the genserv.py app and the genmon.py app can be hosted on a single Raspberry Pi although you should be able to move the genserv.py program to another system with little modification. The web application provides all most of the information supplied by genmon.py. The "registers" command is not supported by the web interface (decided to keep it simple). The setup for flask is detailed at http://flask.pocoo.org/. I did not used a virtual environment since this is a single purpose and low traffic web app (i.e. I do not expose the web app to the internet, only my local network). If you want expose the web app to the internet I would recommend adding authentication, using virtual environment and possibly a full web server to actually serve up the web pages since security concerns would be heightened on a public web server. To install Flask type:

     pip install Flask

The genserv.py program uses the mylog.py and myclient.py modules so they must be in the same directory as genserv.py when it is executed. Genserv.py also uses the same configuration file /etc/genmon.py. The file /var/log/genserv.log is used for logging errors. The program genserv.py has one optional command line argument of the IP address of the system genserv.py is hosted. The default value is localhost, so if no command line argument is supplied the program assumes that genmon.py and genserv.py are on the same system. The flask library serve up static HTML, CSS and javascript files which are stored in a directory below the genserv.py app named static. Below are files and locations for genserv.py:

        ./genserv.py                        - main app
        ./template/command_template.html    - used for error processing in flask
        ./static/index.html                 - main site page
        ./static/genmon.css                 - main site style sheet
        ./static/genmon.js                  - main site javascript
        ./static/favicon.ico                - icon for html file
        ./static/jquery-1.12.4.min.js .     - jquery runtime support

        The default settings provide for hosting the web app on port 8000:

          Example: http://YourIPAddressGoesHere:8000

Internally, the javascript, calls to the genserv.py app, which communicates with genmon.py via private socket calls.

To execute genserv.py as a background process type:

     sudo python genserv.py &

The highlight colors in the web interface will change color based on the generator status (running, ready, exercise).

## /OtherApps/serialtest.py (optional)

The program serialtest.py is a simple application that transmits test data out the serial port and attempts to read the same data back (loopback test). This test can be used to test the serial port and cable. The application takes one optional command line argument of the serial port you are testing with. The default is /dev/serial0. To test port /dev/serial0 type:

     python serialtest.py

To test a USB based serial port type:

     python serialtest.py /dev/ttyUSB0

The program will output success or failure depending on the results of the serial test.

## startgenmon.sh

startgenmon.sh is a Linux script that is designed to be called at system boot from a crontab job. This script can also be called to manually start or stop genmon and genserv. This script assumes that the project files are located in the /home/pi/genmon directory. To start genmon and genserv use the following command:

     /home/pi/genmon/startgenmon.sh start

To stop genmon and genserv use:

     /home/pi/genmon/startgenmon.sh stop

Note that this file may be edited to change the file system location and it may be edited to make other supplied programs start or stop (i.e. gengpio.py and gengpioin.py).

## gensms.py (optional)

The program gensms.py is a program that will send mobile text (SMS) messages when the generator changes state. If you only want simple message notifications from genmon you can use this option and disable email in [mymail.conf](https://github.com/jgyates/genmon/wiki/Software#configuring-mymailpy). gensms.py takes only one command line option but also has a configuration file that must reside in the /etc directory. The name of the configuration file is gensms.conf. This program requires the myclient.py, mylog.py and mynotify.py python modules to be in the same directory as gensms.py.

The SMS implementation utilizes a [Twilio](www.twilio.com) account for sending SMS messages. A free trial account is available and pricing for a non-trial account information is on the Twilio site. 

The program will send a short text message when the generator enters the following states: READY, RUNNING, RUNNING in MANUAL Mode, EXERCISING, ALARM, SERVICEDUE, OFF, OFF in MANUAL MODE.

To install the Twilio support library type:

     sudo pip install twilio
     
The following entries must be present in the gensms.conf file:


     [gensms]
     # Twilio account SID. This can be obtained from a valid Twilio
     # account
     accountsid = ACXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

     # Twilio authentication token. This can be obtained from a valid
     #  Twilio account
     authtoken = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

     # Mobile number to send SMS message to. This can be any mobile
     #  number.
     to_number = +15551234567

     # Number to send SMS message from. This should be a twilio phone
     #  number
     from_number = +1555XXXXXXX
     
To run gensms.py as a background application type:

     python gensms.py <IP Address or localhost> &
     
To stop gensms.py type:

     sudo pkill -f gensms.py
     
Any errors will be logged to /etc/gensms.log

## genpushover.py (Optional)

The genpushover.py module, provided by @sjbader, will send push notifications via the Pushover Application Framework to a mobile device with the Pushover Application installed. To use this module:

Create an account at [pushover.net](https://pushover.net).

Install chump on your raspberry pi:

    sudo pip install chump

Copy genpushover.py to the root directory where all your other genmon files are since this modules uses other support modules in the genmon project.

Copy genpushover.conf to /etc and configure as following:

  * appid - This is generated when you log into pushover.net and at the bottom next to "Your applications" click on "Create Application/API Token". Once you create your app, you're provided with a long and unique application/API token. Add this token to the appid value in the genpushover.conf file

  * userid - This is your user key and is provided when you log into pushover.net.

  * pushsound - This is the custom sound field. I want my genmon to sound different than other alerts, so I don't choose the default. There is a link to the list of options in the .conf file.

Modify the startgenmon.sh script to uncomment the following lines to start the app:

    sudo python /home/pi/genmon/genpushover.py &

Modify the startgenmon.sh script to uncomment the following line to stop the app:

    sudo pkill -f genpushover.py


# Hardware

This project has been developed and tested with a Raspberry Pi 3 as the base platform. Since the serial port and network are the only external ports used, the program could be used on other platforms with minor modifications and testing.

In development and testing I used the Raspberry Pi3 with built in WiFi. Depending on your WiFi signal and your generator proximity to the access point your results may vary.

Below is a list of hardware that I used. Since your generator may be different and your network will be different you will need to validate these for your setup.

* Raspberry PI 3 and SD Card
* [Battery to USB Power Supply](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01DYE54LI/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
      
     Power supply for the Raspberry Pi is attached to battery on the generator. Note, this is needed to ensure the raspberry Pi and the generator controller share a common ground. If you use a two prong wall adapter to power your pi you will likely see CRC errors since the controller cable does not include a ground wire for the serial device.
This is the power supply I used, which allows the Pi to be powered from the generator battery:

* [This is the enclosure that is used.](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UPAN0W/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    This may be to large for some smaller air-cooled generators:
* [Internal Panel for Enclosure](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B005UPE614/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
    This may be to large for some smaller air-cooled generators.
* [Adhesive Magnets from Hobby Lobby](http://www.hobbylobby.com/Crafts-Hobbies/Basic-Crafts/Magnets/1%22---8-Pieces-Square-Magnets-with-Foam-Adhesive/p/25089) (used to attach enclosure to generator). I attached the
    enclosure to the inside of my generator housing but your generator may be different.
* [Wire (for cable) 18 or 20 AWG](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B01LH1FQJ0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1502552173&sr=8-3&keywords=18+awg+wire)
* [Tubing for cable](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00542XWXG/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)  (not recommended, possibly use a smaller diameter tube)
    

    The cable I used connects the Molex connector on the Evolution /Nexus Controller to a DB-9 break-out
    connector. The DB-9 break-out connector is then attached to the RS-232 to TTL converter for the
    Raspberry Pi. Below are the links for the items used in cabling:

* [Molex Crimp tool for cable](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OMM4YUY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* [3.3v TTL to RS232 for RPi](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EJ9NAKA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* Break out db-9 ([male](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B014FKU5W8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
) or [female](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B014FM8MNK/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), depending on the above level converter you use)

* I used the following Digi-key part numbers for the molex connectors for the cable. The evolution controller uses a molex type receptacle:


This is the part number of the connector that you will use on your cable (plug). This is required.
   
   * Receptacle = WM3703-ND - [DigiKey Link](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/molex-llc/39-01-2080/WM3703-ND/61382)
   * Female pin = WM3279CT-ND - [DigiKey Link](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=WM3279CT)

This is the part number of the connector on the controller (receptacle). This is for informational purposes and is not required.
   * Plug = WM3603-ND
   * Male pin = WM2500CT-ND

I used a molex connector on my enclosure and routed the two wires to a break-out box that a DB-9 (see link above) however there are endless ways to make the connection to your enclosure on the Pi.
